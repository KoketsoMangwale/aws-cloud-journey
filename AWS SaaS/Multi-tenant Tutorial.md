## üìò Tutorial: Serverless SaaS Multi‚ÄëTenant on AWS

This tutorial is based on the **AWS SaaS Factory Serverless Workshop**‚Äîa current, hands-on guide for migrating a monolithic app to a serverless, multi-tenant architecture ([github.com][1]).
It is **step-by-step beginner‚Äëfriendly** for building a multi-tenant serverless SaaS‚Äîwithout Cloud9 and with minimal storage usage. We'll use **AWS CloudShell**.

### üß≠ Prerequisites

* AWS account (free tier OK)
* AWS CLI configured
* \~16‚ÄØGB free disk on CloudShell overlay directory
* Tools: `git`, `sam`, `node`, `npm`, `kubectl` (only if Kubernetes is used)

---

### üöÄ Step 1: Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-saas-factory-serverless-workshop.git
cd aws-saas-factory-serverless-workshop
```

I had the issue with limited disk size so I switched to this directory before cloning the repository.
```
cd /tmp
```

This repo includes labs 1‚Äì4 that cover onboarding, multi-tenancy, pooled data models, and isolation ([docs.aws.amazon.com][2], [github.com][1]).

### üîß Step 2: Provision Infrastructure


### üîπ 2.1 Set Up a Bucket (once per region)

```bash
export BUCKET=my-saas-workshop-bucket
aws s3 mb s3://$BUCKET
curl -O https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-saas-factory-serverless-saas-workshop-us-west-2/workshop.template
aws s3 cp workshop.template s3://$BUCKET/
```

## üß† Understanding the Linux & AWS CLI Commands

You are creating an S3 bucket, uploading a CloudFormation template, and then using that template to create AWS resources.

##### `export BUCKET=my-saas-workshop-bucket`

### üßæ What it does:

* This creates a **temporary environment variable** called `BUCKET` and assigns it the value `my-saas-workshop-bucket`. (Make sure the bucket name is unique)

### üß† Why it's useful:

* It allows you to use `$BUCKET` as a shortcut instead of typing the full bucket name again and again in future commands.

### üí° Example:

```bash
echo $BUCKET
```

Will return:

```
my-saas-workshop-bucket
```

---

#### `aws s3 mb s3://$BUCKET`

### üßæ What it does:

* `aws s3 mb` = **Make Bucket** ‚Äî this command **creates a new S3 bucket**.
* `s3://$BUCKET` = this uses the value of the `BUCKET` variable you just set.

### üí° Example:

If `$BUCKET` is `my-saas-workshop-bucket`, then the command becomes:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://my-saas-workshop-bucket
```

‚úÖ After running, you should see:

```
make_bucket: my-saas-workshop-bucket
```

üü° **Note:** Bucket names must be globally unique. If someone else already used that name, pick a unique one like:

```bash
export BUCKET=my-saas-workshop-bucket-2025-koketso
```

---

#### `curl -O https://.../workshop.template .`

### üßæ What it does:

* This will download the file `workshop.template` to your current directory (e.g., /tmp).
* `https://...` = this is the URL of the workshop template stored publicly in S3

### ‚úÖ This downloads the `workshop.template` file into your current directory.

---

#### `aws s3 cp workshop.template s3://$BUCKET/`

### üßæ What it does:

* This **uploads** the `workshop.template` you just downloaded to your own S3 bucket.

### üí° Example:

```bash
aws s3 cp workshop.template s3://my-saas-workshop-bucket/
```

‚úÖ You‚Äôll see something like:

```
upload: ./workshop.template to s3://my-saas-workshop-bucket/workshop.template
```

---
### üîπ 2.2 Create and Deploy CludFormation Stack

###### `aws cloudformation create-stack \ ...`

This command **deploys the stack** using CloudFormation.

### üí• Let's break it down:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name saas-workshop \
  --template-url https://$BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com/workshop.template \
  --parameters ParameterKey=EEAssetsBucket,ParameterValue=$BUCKET \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

### ‚úÖ What each line means:

| Part                                                                | Meaning                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aws cloudformation create-stack`                                   | Start creating a CloudFormation stack                               |
| `--stack-name saas-workshop`                                        | Give your stack a name (so you can manage/delete it later)          |
| `--template-url https://$BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com/workshop.template` | Tells CloudFormation where to find your template                    |
| `--parameters ParameterKey=EEAssetsBucket,ParameterValue=$BUCKET`   | Passes input parameters (the bucket name) to the template           |
| `--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`                               | Allows CloudFormation to create IAM roles (needed for Lambda, etc.) |

‚úÖ If it runs successfully, you'll see output like:

```
{
    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/saas-workshop/..."
}
```

üü° **Note:** If it fails, it might be because:

* The bucket name is already taken (use a unique one).
* You didn‚Äôt upload the template.
* You don‚Äôt have IAM permissions.

## üß† Final Notes for Beginners

| Command                           | What it does                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `export`                          | Defines a variable for use in your terminal session |
| `$BUCKET`                         | References the value of a variable                  |
| `aws s3 mb`                       | Makes a bucket                                      |
| `aws s3 cp`                       | Copies files to/from S3                             |
| `aws cloudformation create-stack` | Deploys AWS resources using a template              |


### üîπ 2.3. Upload CloudFormation Template

```bash
aws s3 cp workshop.template s3://$BUCKET_NAME/
```

> If `workshop.template` is not already in the repo, you can download it:

```bash
curl -O https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-saas-factory-serverless-saas-workshop-us-west-2/workshop.template
aws s3 cp workshop.template s3://$BUCKET_NAME/
```

---

### üîπ 2.4. Deploy the Stack via CloudFormation

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name saas-workshop \
  --template-url https://$BUCKET_NAME.s3.amazonaws.com/workshop.template \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

---

### üîπ


Use CloudFormation to launch the stack:

```bash
export BUCKET=my-saas-workshop-bucket
aws s3 mb s3://$BUCKET

aws s3 cp https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-saas-factory-serverless-saas-workshop-us-west-2/workshop.template .
aws s3 cp workshop.template s3://$BUCKET/

aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name saas-workshop \
  --template-url https://$BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com/workshop.template \
  --parameters ParameterKey=EEAssetsBucket,ParameterValue=$BUCKET \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

This deploys the baseline serverless environment, including frontend, shared services, and backend microservices ([github.com][1], [aws.amazon.com][3]).

---

### üß™ Step 3: Lab 1 ‚Äì Monolith Review

Explore the single-tenant legacy:

* HTML/JS frontend served from S3/CloudFront
* API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí DynamoDB product/order services

Understand how current services work.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Lab 2 ‚Äì Onboarding & Shared Services

* Deploy Lambdas and Cognito user pool for tenant registration
* Introduce shared services:

  * Registration service
  * Tenant management
  * User management via Cognito
* Capture tenant context (like `tenantId`) in JWT tokens ([github.com][1], [d1.awsstatic.com][4], [aws.amazon.com][3])

---

### üîê Step 5: Lab 3 ‚Äì Multi‚ÄëTenant Logic (Pooled Model)

* Modify backend Lambdas to include tenant scoping
* Use pooled DynamoDB table with `tenantId` as partition key
* Update API Gateway authorizers to pass tenant context from JWT to backend functions&#x20;

---

### üîí Step 6: Lab 4 ‚Äì Data Isolation & Pool Model

* Enhance functions to securely isolate data by tenant
* Apply IAM conditions (e.g., `LeadingKeys`) to restrict access based on `tenantId` ([aws.amazon.com][3])

---

### üß™ Step 7: Lab 5 & Beyond (Optional)

* Tier-based deployment (silo vs shared)
* API throttling via tenant usage plans
* Observability with CloudWatch
* CI/CD via CodePipeline ([d1.awsstatic.com][4], [aws.amazon.com][3])

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Use CloudShell Instead of Cloud9 or Local

* CloudShell gives you **preconfigured AWS CLI**, \~1‚ÄØGB home dir, and persistent storage.
* Clone repo and follow steps above.
* Clean up with: `aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name saas-workshop`
* For large builds, run in `/tmp` or offload artifacts to S3.
